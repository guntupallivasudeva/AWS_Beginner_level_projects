### 32. Terminate Previous Instances and  Create New Instances
1. **Terminate Previous Instances**:  
   - Go to the EC2 Dashboard.
   - Select the instances you want to terminate.
   - Click on "Actions" > "Instance State" > "Terminate".
2. **Create New Instances**:
    - Go to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Click on "Launch Instance".
    - Instance Name: `Instance - MyOrg VPC 1` and  `Instance - MyOrg VPC 2`.
    - Select the AMI as `Amazon Linux 2023 AMI`, instance type as `t3.micro`, and Key Pair select Proceed without a key pair(not recommended).
    - Configure the instance details:
        - Network: Select `MyOrg VPC-1` for the first instance and `MyOrg VPC-2` for the second instance.
        - Subnet: Select the respective public subnet for each VPC.
        - Auto-assign Public IP: Enable this option.
    - Create security group name as `MyOrg SG 1` & `MyOrg SG 2`.
        - Allow inbound traffic on port 22 (SSH) from your IP address.
        - Allow inbound traffic on port range All (All ICMP - IPv4) from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0). For both instances.
    - Review and launch the instance.

### 34. Test VPC Peering Connection

1. **Check VPC Peering Connection Status**:
   - Go to the VPC Dashboard.
   - Click on "Peering Connections" in the left sidebar.
   - Select the peering connection `VPC 1 <> VPC 2`.
   - Ensure the status is `Active`.
2. **Test Connectivity**:
    - Go to the EC2 Dashboard.
    - Select the instance `Instance - MyOrg VPC 1`.
    - Click on "Connect" and choose "Session Manager".
    - In the terminal, run the following command to test connectivity to the instance in VPC 2:   

```bash
    ping <Private IP of Instance - MyOrg VPC 2>
  ```

- If you receive responses, the peering connection is working correctly.

![test](https://github.com/guntupallivasudeva/AWS_Beginner_level_projects/blob/main/AWS%20Cloud%20Networking%20Series/7.%20VPC%20Monitoring%20with%20Flow%20Logs/Images/13.%20Test%201.png?raw=true)  

    - See if you can test the connection from VPC 1 to VPC 2's public IP address.
    - Head back to your EC2 console, and copy the Public IPv4 address of Instance - NextWork VPC 2.
    - Your final result should look similar to something like¬†

    ```bash
      ping <public IPv4 address>
    ```
- If you receive responses, the peering connection is working correctly.

![test 2](https://github.com/guntupallivasudeva/AWS_Beginner_level_projects/blob/main/AWS%20Cloud%20Networking%20Series/7.%20VPC%20Monitoring%20with%20Flow%20Logs/Images/14.%20Test%202%20.png?raw=true)  

- If Got any error please check the following:
  - Ensure that the security groups and network ACLs allow traffic between the two VPCs.
  - Check the route tables in both VPCs to ensure they have routes for the peered VPC's CIDR block.
  - my suggestion is to check the previous project that is [VPC Peering Connection]then you can find the solution.

- If you got everything right, thats good you have successfully completed the project.
- Now you may test some another extension as an option.
-Another optional extension! Back in your EC2 Instance Connect tab, run the same ping command but add -c 5 to the end of the command.  

  ```bash
    ping -c 5 <Private IP of Instance - MyOrg VPC 2>
  ```

![test 3](https://github.com/guntupallivasudeva/AWS_Beginner_level_projects/blob/main/AWS%20Cloud%20Networking%20Series/7.%20VPC%20Monitoring%20with%20Flow%20Logs/Images/15.%20Test%203.png?raw=true)  

- you should see 5 pings sent and automatically finish after 5 packets, which means the peering connection is working correctly.


![last test](https://github.com/guntupallivasudeva/AWS_Beginner_level_projects/blob/main/AWS%20Cloud%20Networking%20Series/7.%20VPC%20Monitoring%20with%20Flow%20Logs/Images/16.%20last%20test.png?raw=true)

### 35. Analyze Flow Logs

- Head to your CloudWatch console.
- Click on "Log groups" in the left sidebar.
- Select the log group `MyOrgVPCFlowLogsGroup`.
- Click into your log stream to see flow logs from EC2 Instance 1
- You should see logs similar to the following:
  ```
  2023-10-01T12:00:00.000Z MyOrgVPCFlowLog 1234567890123456 1234567890123456 eni-1234567890abcdef    
  ACCEPT OK```

![log groups](https://github.com/guntupallivasudeva/AWS_Beginner_level_projects/blob/main/AWS%20Cloud%20Networking%20Series/7.%20VPC%20Monitoring%20with%20Flow%20Logs/Images/17.%20LogGroups.png?raw=true)  

- The log entries will contain information about the traffic flowing through the VPC, including source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
- You can use these logs to monitor and analyze network traffic, troubleshoot issues, and ensure compliance with security policies.
- In the left hand navigation panel, click on¬†Logs Insights.
- Select the log group `MyOrgVPCFlowLogsGroup` from the select log group dropdown.
- select the Query folder on the right hand size.
- Under Flow Logs, select¬†Top 10 byte transfers by source and destination IP addresses.
- Click¬†Apply,¬†and then¬†Run query.
- Review the query results.
